## DeRPS-Frontend-JS

This is the frontend code for DeRPS. It includes the ethers v6 Sapphire wrapper (https://api.docs.oasis.io/js/sapphire-ethers-v6/) to encrypt transactions. This is an extremely minimal proof of concept for educational purposes, and only implements single-player RPS based on random number generation using Sapphire.RandomBytes, therefore the use of privacy isn't actually needed here. However, for multiplayer gameplay privacy would be needed to prevent frontrunning.
